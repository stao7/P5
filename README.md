# P5: Evolutionary Impressions
*In this project, we are trying to use evolutionary algorithms to generate mutated elements*

The design parameter I chose were color RGB values, width, height and the drawing's vertex values of the drawing because I tried to let it mutates different colors, position and size of the shape to convert the drawing to best fit the image.

The mutation approach of each image is different, the sunflower has the mutation value of color and size of circles to adjust and compare with the image.
And for the rainbow flag, because of the specialty of the image is color, so I used only mutation of color to let it adjust from dark to bright.
In the end, the chocolate is also mutating with color and size.

I was trying to do things like let the components of the drawings draw themselves while mutating, however I found this really difficult to do because how the mutation function works, therefore in the end I convert the adjustable values to colors, size and position.
